## Firs of all remove first line of *entropy* files
## Note we are going to replace 'genes' with their 'functions' only in the essentiality_hit_tables, i.e. gene*condition matrices (not gene*gen matrices)

remove all duplicates, i.e. in gene-func mapping file, remove lines with their first column being the same

## when you remove dups with below awk command, you look at rows of "1_gene_function_mapping", and if the first col has been seen already, you exclude it.
## But there is an issue here, what if we have 2 lines like this "Rv0001 S" and  then "Rv0001 J". In this cas, you keep 1st one and exclude 2nd one. BUT we are NOT interested in "S" and "R"!
## SOOO it's better to remove "S" and "R" first (we can exlude "N" and "A" here as well):
cp 1_gene_function_mapping temp
sed -i '/,R/d' temp
sed -i '/S/d' temp
sed -i '/A/d' temp
sed -i '/N/d' temp
sed -i 's/,/\t/g' temp
wc -l temp
wc -l 1_gene_function_mapping_remove_all_dups


## use "shuf" to get different genes (functions) to be removed/kept each time
shuf temp > temp2
awk '!seen[$1]++' temp2 > 1_gene_function_mapping_remove_all_dups
rm temp temp2
sort 1_gene_function_mapping_remove_all_dups -o 1_gene_function_mapping_remove_all_dups 
wc -l 1_gene_function_mapping_remove_all_dups


join --nocheck-order 1_gene_function_mapping_remove_all_dups result_gumbel_hit_table_zbar.dat | cut -f2- -d' ' > 2_gumbel_hit_zbar_ready_no_dups


## don't forget to add column names from orig files:
head -1 result_gumbel_hit_table_zbar.dat


sed -i 's/ /	/g' 2_gumbel_hit_zbar_ready_no_dups
